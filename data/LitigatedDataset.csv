" Systems, methods, and computer program products are disclosed for establishing and using credit limits between counterparties and for managing risk in the trading of financial interests. The invention provides a trading party with the ability to control the amount of future financial exposure that the trading party will incur with any counterparty in one or more future time periods in trades by the trading party during a trading session. A trading party may establish and use credit limits with potential counterparties in the trading of financial interests having a future financial exposure such as foreign exchange (  FX  ) forwards contracts, forwards contracts in commodities, e.g., precious metals, energy, etc., stock options, futures contracts, bonds, loan contracts, money market certificates, other fixed income securities, etc. Credit limits may be used to permit proposed trades to be completed or not depending upon available credit. Where there is insufficient credit, the trade may be blocked or otherwise prevented from progressing towards completion. For example, upon attempted acceptance of an unfiltered proposed trade, credit is checked for one or both parties. If there is sufficient credit, the trade is permitted to progress towards completion. If there is insufficient credit and if trading up to available credit is permitted, a partial trade for an amount up to the credit limit may be allowed. If a financial exposure associated with the proposed trade is greater than an available portion of a credit limit associated with the trading party, the potential counterparty, and a time period associated with the proposed trade, the proposed trade is not processed towards completion, or the price, size, or quantity of the proposed trade is capped. The future time periods (tenors for FX forwards contracts) may be selected by the trading parties, e.g., either or both a start date and an end date of such time periods may be selected. During a trading session, the credit remaining of a set credit limit between the trading party and the respective counterparty is changed according to trades executed between the trading party and the counterparty. After the end of the trading session, the remaining credit is automatically reset to the set credit limit for each counterparty and future time period. ",Yes
" A method is disclosed involving acquiring a plurality of charge accounts. The accounts are of a type normally issued with an associated physically producible card which may be presented as evidence of an existing charge account, the physically producible cards bearing human readable account numbers and expiration dates. The plurality of charge accounts are capable of being gifted to a party, after acquisition. A request is received from a first party to gift a charge account to a second party having a name, without both the issuance and provision of a physical card for the charge account to the second party. The first party and the second party are different from each other. The charge account is usable in the name of the second party at any merchant who is capable of seeking authorization, using an authorization infrastructure, for purchases involving charge accounts for which the physically producible cards are issued, whether or not the physical cards evidencing the accounts are presented by purchasers when a purchase is made. An account parameter, selected by the first party, is accepted. The second party is informed of the account, by sending an e-mail to the second party. The e-mail contains a greeting selected by the first party and directs the second party to perform a specified action in order to cause an activation of the account. The account is activated for usage by the second party according to the account parameter. An indication that the second party has made a purchase from a merchant using the account is received and a settling transaction involving the account is undertaken after the usage by the second party. A system is also disclosed having a database with at least one table and a processor coupled to the database. The database is configured to, under control of the processor, maintain a record of a payment card account registered to a first person at the request of a second person, and for which, at no time at or before a time the second person buys from a merchant and provides payment by referencing the payment card account, no physical card for the payment card account will have been provided to the second person.

" This invention presents a method for pricing an option. The steps for this method include configuring a general option pricing model with parameters to conform the model to a market behavior of an underlying asset. A price for an option is then calculated using the model. The configured model can be calibrated to implied volatility data describing the current state of the market. The underlying asset can include commodity prices, interest rates, and currency exchange rates. More than one general option pricing models can be used to price the option. Additionally, correlations between the general option pricing models can be included in the calculation. The configuring of the parameters can be done through the formula: &lt;maths id=  MATH-US-00001   num=  00001  &gt; &lt;MATH OVERFLOW=  SCROLL  &gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MFRAC&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MI&gt;dF&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;MO&gt;‚Å°&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MO&gt;(&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MI&gt;t&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;MO&gt;,&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MSTYLE&gt; &lt;mspace width=  0.3em   height=  0.3ex  /&gt; &lt;/MSTYLE&gt; &lt;MO&gt;‚Å¢&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MI&gt;T&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;MO&gt;)&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MI&gt;F&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;MO&gt;‚Å°&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MO&gt;(&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MI&gt;t&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;MO&gt;,&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MI&gt;T&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;MO&gt;)&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;/MFRAC&gt; &lt;MO&gt;=&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MUNDER&gt; &lt;MO&gt;‚àë&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MI&gt;a&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;/MUNDER&gt; &lt;MO&gt;‚Å¢&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MO&gt;[&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MUNDER&gt; &lt;MO&gt;‚àë&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MI&gt;i&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;/MUNDER&gt; &lt;MO&gt;‚Å¢&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MSUB&gt; &lt;MI&gt;y&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;MI&gt;ia&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;/MSUB&gt; &lt;MO&gt;‚Å¢&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MSUB&gt; &lt;MI&gt;B&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;MI&gt;i&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;/MSUB&gt; &lt;MO&gt;‚Å°&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MO&gt;(&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MI&gt;t&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;MO&gt;,&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MI&gt;T&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;MO&gt;)&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;MO&gt;‚Å¢&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MSUB&gt; &lt;MI&gt;g&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;MI&gt;i&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;/MSUB&gt; &lt;MO&gt;‚Å°&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MO&gt;(&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MI&gt;T&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;MO&gt;)&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;MO&gt;]&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;MO&gt;‚Å¢&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MSUB&gt; &lt;MI&gt;sigma&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;MI&gt;a&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;/MSUB&gt; &lt;MO&gt;‚Å°&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MO&gt;(&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MI&gt;t&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;MO&gt;)&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;MO&gt;‚Å¢&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MSUB&gt; &lt;MI&gt;dz&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;MI&gt;a&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;/MSUB&gt; &lt;MO&gt;‚Å°&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MROW&gt; &lt;MO&gt;(&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;MI&gt;t&lt;/MI&gt; &lt;MO&gt;)&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;MO&gt;,&lt;/MO&gt; &lt;/MROW&gt; &lt;/MATH&gt; &lt;/MATHS&gt; wherein F(t, T) represents the value of the underlying asset and dF(t, T) represents a change in the value of the underlying asset; a represents randomness factors; i represents an amount of mean reversion factors used in the model; t represents the current time; T represents the forward time; y&lt;SUB&gt;ia &lt;/SUB&gt;represents the move shape coefficient; B&lt;SUB&gt;i&lt;/SUB&gt;(t, T) represents the mean reversion factor; g&lt;SUB&gt;i&lt;/SUB&gt;(T) represents the volatility adjustment factor; sigma&lt;SUB&gt;a&lt;/SUB&gt;(t) represents the instantaneous factor volatility; and dz&lt;SUB&gt;a&lt;/SUB&gt;(t) represents the random increment.

" Contact structures exhibiting resilience or compliance for a variety of electronic components are formed by bonding a free end of a wire to a substrate, configuring the wire into a wire stem having a springable shape, severing the wire stem, and overcoating the wire stem with at least one layer of a material chosen primarily for its structural (resiliency, compliance) characteristics. A variety of techniques for configuring, severing, and overcoating the wire stem are disclosed. In an exemplary embodiment, a free end of a wire stem is bonded to a contact area on a substrate, the wire stem is configured to have a springable shape, the wire stem is severed to be free-standing by an electrical discharge, and the free-standing wire stem is overcoated by plating. A variety of materials for the wire stem (which serves as a falsework) and for the overcoat (which serves as a superstructure over the falsework) are disclosed. Various techniques are described for mounting the contact structures to a variety of electronic components (e.g., semiconductor wafers and dies, semiconductor packages, interposers, interconnect substrates, etc.), and various process sequences are described. The resilient contact structures described herein are ideal for making a   temporary   (probe) connections to an electronic component such as a semiconductor die, for burn-in and functional testing. The self-same resilient contact structures can be used for subsequent permanent mounting of the electronic component, such as by soldering to a printed circuit board (PCB). An irregular topography can be created on or imparted to the tip of the contact structure to enhance its ability to interconnect resiliently with another electronic component. Among the numerous advantages of the present invention is the great facility with which the tips of a plurality of contact structures can be made to be coplanar with one another. Other techniques and embodiments, such as wherein the falsework wirestem protrudes beyond an end of the superstructure, or is melted down, and wherein multiple free-standing resilient contact structures can be fabricated from loops, are described.

" A method of providing financial advice to a client that provides sufficient confidence that their goals will be achieved or exceeded but that avoids excessive sacrifice to the client's current or future lifestyle and avoids investment risk that is not needed to provide sufficient confidence of the goals a client personally values. The method comprises obtaining typical client background information, as well as a list of investment goals, and ideal and acceptable values in dollar amounts and timing for each goal. The client is then asked to provide their preferences for each goal on the list compared to each other goal in the list, wherein the client's preference is expressed in terms of the price, in money or time, that the client is willing to pay in one goal to achieve another goal or a greater amount or sooner timing of other goals on the list. A matrix can be used to express these value contrasts. A recommendation is then created using the portfolio value, and the client goal preferences and the ideal and acceptable values of goals, by simulating models of the relevant capital markets and investing exclusively in passive investment alternatives to avoid the risk of potential material underperformance of active investments under the premise of avoiding investment risk that is not needed to confidently buy the client the goals they personally value. The recommendation may include a range of portfolio values over their life or time horizon within which the client's portfolio should remain in order to ensure the recommendation remains within a   comfort zone  , which represents sufficient confidence that the client's goals will be achieved while avoiding excessive current sacrifice. Periodic monitoring of the recommendation is also performed to capture changes to the client's goals and actual portfolio values based on the results of the capital markets. Appropriate changes to the recommendation can then be made to ensure that the recommendation remains within the   comfort zone   ",No
" A system and method for delivering purchasing incentives and a variety of other retail shopping aids through a computer network, such as by E-mail over the Internet or the World Wide Web. Customers (10) of retail stores can establish a bidirectional communication link with the system, log in (16) to the system, and then elect to browse among available purchasing incentive offers (18, 22), or elect to explore other shopping aids, such as a shopping list generator (26), a recipe center (30), or simply elect to claim a product rebate or to receive product information. If the customer elects to have product information or rebate information delivered, only minimal customer identification is required. For purchase incentives redeemable at retail stores, the customer must provide identification information and must also designate a retailer (12) at which the purchasing incentive can be exercised. For receipt of focused incentives based the customer's past shopping behavior, the customer must also supply a unique customer id., such as a check cashing card number or credit card number, used for in-store purchases. For delivery of a product sample, the customer's name and address must be supplied. The system merges this customer-supplied information (270) with other purchase incentive data (272) and creates a printable graphical image of the purchasing incentive (282) for transmission to the customer. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the purchase incentive is not transmitted directly to the customer. Instead, the terms of the incentive are transmitted electronically to the retail store (310) designated by the customer, who receives either a token (316) to present at the store or an advisory message. In yet another embodiment of the invention, incentives may be targeted to specific consumers based on a consumer purchase history (502), and transmitted to consumers' computers (510) using electronic mail addresses stored in a consumer database (506), or using a   personal page   in the computer network, established for each consenting consumer.

" The present invention generally relates to the field of medical services and more specifically to the area of chronic disease management. It comprises a new method for providing a disease management service which utilizes nurse practitioners to engage in regularly scheduled virtual evaluation and management   office visits   with patients, using off-the-shelf videophones for real-time video and audio communications. As these disease management services are delivered to the patient while he remains in his home, such convenient access to professional health care brings about a much closer monitoring of the patient's condition than would be otherwise practical, enabling clinicians to make necessary therapeutic modifications in a timely fashion. Engaging patients in such regularly scheduled office visits also causes increased compliance with recommended regimens and lifestyle modifications, resulting in overall improved management of the patient's chronic condition. Patients are enrolled into the service primarily through referrals from their primary care physicians who sign a Collaboration Agreement with the chronic disease management service. The Collaboration Agreement extends the continuity of care for enrolled patients by keeping the primary care physician informed at all times on the health status of their patients and involved in all important clinical decisions regarding patients referred to the service. The secure Internet-accessible clinical documentation and information systems used in the disclosed method make possible a multi-office practice were information can be seamlessly shared and patient workloads can be distributed across multiple locations. Clinical office visit services provided under the disclosed method qualify for reimbursement by public insurers and many private insurers. The disclosed method represents a novel form of medical practice whose area of operation and potential patient base is unbounded by geographic location, since patients may engage in virtual office visits while remaining in their homes, and the information technology infrastructure utilized allows the disclosed disease management service to deliver medical care from any location that has phone service and an Internet or network connection available.

" The density of at least one fluid in a pipe 12 is determined using a pair of effective sound speeds a&lt;SUB&gt;1eff &lt;/SUB&gt;and a&lt;SUB&gt;2eff &lt;/SUB&gt;of the fluid/pipe system. The pair of effective system sound speed measurements are taken at two sensing regions X&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;, X&lt;SUB&gt;2 &lt;/SUB&gt;along the pipe wherein each of the sensing regions comprises a different system cross sectional compliance. The pair of effective system sound speeds a&lt;SUB&gt;1eff &lt;/SUB&gt;and a&lt;SUB&gt;2eff &lt;/SUB&gt;are provided to signal processing logic 60, which determines the density of the fluid 13 flowing in the pipe 12. The effective system sound speeds a&lt;SUB&gt;1eff &lt;/SUB&gt;and a&lt;SUB&gt;2eff &lt;/SUB&gt;may be provided by a pair of sound speed meters positioned at sensing regions X&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;, X&lt;SUB&gt;2 &lt;/SUB&gt;wherein the sound speed meters utilize a spatial array of acoustic pressure sensors placed at predetermined axial locations along the pipe 12. The acoustic pressure sensors provide acoustic pressure signals which are utilized to determine the effective system speed of sound a&lt;SUB&gt;1eff &lt;/SUB&gt;and a&lt;SUB&gt;2eff &lt;/SUB&gt;of the fluid (or mixture)/pipe system. One technique uses acoustic spatial array signal processing techniques with the direction of propagation of the acoustic signals along the longitudinal axis of the pipe 12. However, numerous spatial array-processing techniques may be employed to determine the effective system speed of sounds a&lt;SUB&gt;1eff &lt;/SUB&gt;and a&lt;SUB&gt;2eff&lt;/SUB&gt;. The effective system sound speeds a&lt;SUB&gt;1eff &lt;/SUB&gt;and a&lt;SUB&gt;2eff &lt;/SUB&gt;measured utilize one-dimensional planar acoustic waves that are lower in frequency (and longer wavelength) signals than those used for ultrasonic flow meters, and thus incorporates pipe compliance with fluid compliance and further is more tolerant to inhomogeneities in the flow. In addition, no external source is required and thus may operate using passive listening. The invention will work with arbitrary sound speed meter spacing and with as few as two sound speed meters. The density meter may also be combined with an instrument, an opto-electronic converter and a controller in an industrial process control system. ",Yes
" A document is operatively coupled to a printing device, either directly or through a network such as the Internet. A print schedule is stored that keeps track of when a document should be printed on the printing device. When the print schedule indicates the document should be printed, the document is automatically transmitted to the printing device without user intervention. The printing device automatically prints the document, again without user intervention. The document can be stored on a electronic device, such as a personal computer connected to the printing device, or can be stored on a document server accessible to the printing device through the Internet. A user profile is stored that contains information about the recipient of the document, such as name, email address, household income, and interests. This user profile is updated when a document is printed on the printing device. This user profile can be used to select specific information of interest to the user to be included in a personalized document. Since advertising can also be included in the document, the user profile can also be used to select advertising likely to be of interest to the user to be included in the personalized document. A product can be subsidized for a user, based on the information contained in the user profile. For example, if a user profile indicates that a specific user has printed a specific number of   preferred   documents, such as those documents containing advertising or otherwise under the control of the document delivery system, a product such as a print consumable, such as an inkjet cartridge or a laser toner cartridge, can automatically be sent to the user. Likewise, printable media such as paper can also automatically be sent to user. Alternatively, coupons for free or discounted products such as those described above can be mailed, sent electronically, or otherwise distributed to the user. ",Yes
" A financial securitization transaction, such as a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) transaction, that (i) is at least partially collateralized by a plurality of net lease assets where the tenants to the leases are financial institutions generally with assets of less than $10 billion, and (ii) where such securitization may not be fully collateralized by such net lease assets, in which case the remainder of the collateral for such securitization may consist predominantly of obligations (including trust preferred securities, debt and/or surplus notes) of financial institutions, and/or traunches of CDOs backed predominantly by such obligations. By restricting the assets to net lease assets in which the tenants are financial institutions and restricting the remaining assets to predominately obligations of financial institutions or tranches of CDOs backed by such obligations, more favorable ratings are obtainable from the ratings agencies for the securities backed by the net lease assets. In accordance with an important aspect of the present invention, the ratings of the debt securities of the securitization rely on the aggregate pooled credit quality of the multiple financial institutions backing the various net lease assets and the geographic diversity of such financial institutions, instead of on the explicit investment ratings of any one of the individual obligors in the pool. In accordance with another important aspect of the present invention, as opposed to the typical 5%-10% recovery rate assumed for traditional financial institution collateral used in pooled financial institution obligation CDO transactions, the net lease assets are collateralized by property, which translates into a materially higher assumed recovery rate, for example, in excess of 40%. Through the mechanism of the balloon payment provider (which is also an important aspect of the present invention), the net lease assets do not require residual value insurance and the need for equity capital is significantly reduced or even eliminated.

" Ongoing growth in transport demand is served while deferring or eliminating expenditure for additional capacity by reclaiming the protection capacity and inefficiently used working capacity in existing multi-ring network. Reclamation is through re-design of the routing and restoration in the network using mesh principles within the pre-existing ring capacities. The installed working and protection capacity of existing rings is viewed as a sunk investment, an existing resource, to be   mined   and incorporated into a mesh- operated network that serves both existing and ongoing growth. Three ways of approaching the idea are given. The last is a detailed planning model for minimum cost evolution out to a given total growth multiplier (or a scenario of individual future growth multipliers on each O-D pair) that considers the costs of new mesh capacity additions, nodal costs for mesh access to existing ring working and protection capacity and selective ADM conversions and re-use decisions. Depending on details of the initial ring network design, results show that in some cases a complete doubling or even tripling of demand could be supported with little or no additional capacity investment through the period of ring-to-mesh conversion by ring-mining. The strategy may mean that an operator that could handle the administrative process of conversion could access the opportunity to grow their business for a year or more without capital additions for transport capacity. This re-capture of existing installed protection capacity for conversion to service-bearing use would be a one time business strategy opportunity made possible by a ring mining conversion from ring to mesh. The option is also given to mine the existing ring set to a target architecture of   p-cycles   instead of a span-restorable mesh, through placement of straddling span interface units to convert ring ADMs to p-cycle nodal elements.

" A library checking system for use with books provided with RFID tags comprises a terminal 1 incorporating a housing 15 within which a book is contained during checking, and an identification antenna 17 for detecting the RFID tag of the book while within the housing 15 and for supplying a signal identifying the book to a central processor. A book slot 2 through which the book is insertable for checking opens into the housing 15, and an output from the housing 15 is provided through which the book is discharged to a pick-up area in the event of the book being passed by the central processor as available for borrowing. A pivotable bookdrop flap 14 is provided within the housing 15 on which the book is supported during detection by the identification antenna 17, the flap 14 being pivotable to cause the book to drop into a bookdrop bin 12 in the event of the book not being passed by the central processor as available for borrowing. Such a system enables a book or other borrowable item to be automatically issued to a user when the item is passed by the central processor as being available for borrowing. In this case the user may collect the book from the pick-up area and can take the book out of the library without any manual checking system being required. In the event that the book is found not to be available for borrowing, for example because the book has been reserved by another user or a payment is outstanding, the book is automatically passed to a secure receptacle, thus preventing the user from borrowing the book and enabling the book to be manually returned to the required library location in due course.| ",Yes
" A unitary investment instrument combining a swap and a structured note, both of which provide multiple utilization of capital. The unitary instrument has three performance components. An investor invests in the issuer the principal amount of the structured note component. The structured note provides its own portfolio exposures as well as serving as collateral for the base benchmark portfolio swap (alternatively, the base benchmark portfolio exposure can be acquired through a separate collateral deposit on the investor's own portfolio). The first component is a benchmark portfolio, which in one preferred embodiment is a financial or stock index such as the S&amp;P 500 Stock Index. The second component is an incremental benchmark portfolio keyed to the same benchmark index and the third component is keyed to a passive commodity index, having long and short positions, which in one preferred embodiment is the Mount Lucas Management Commodity Index. The instrument's passive commodity index exposure is established as the product of a leverage factor and the amount of the benchmark portfolio exposure; thereafter this exposure may be the product of (1) a leverage factor and/or (2) the change in value of the overall investment, the benchmark component and/or the commodity index component. The basic return to the investor comprises the change in value of the benchmark, the incremental benchmark and the passive commodity index exposure over a predetermined period of time. The structured note component of the investment instrument includes a guarantee of the return of the investment principal; the swap does not do so, but rather reflects the full risk of the benchmark portfolio exposure. However, research indicates that the unitary swap/structured note instrument has an unusually high probability of outperforming the benchmark index across a wide range of market cycles. ",No

" Fraud losses in a communication network are substantially reduced by automatically and selectively invoking one or more authentication measures based on a fraud score that indicates the likelihood of fraud for that particular call or previously scored calls. By selectively invoking authentication on only those calls that are suspected or confirmed to be fraudulent, fraud prevention can be achieved in a way that both reduces fraud losses and minimizes disruptions to legitimate subscribers. Using telecommunication fraud as an example, a subscriber is registered in a system by collecting data on that subscriber based on the particular authentication method being used, such as shared knowledge (e.g., passwords), biometric validation (e.g., voice verification), and the like. Once registered, the authentication function for the subscriber's account is activated and subsequent calls are then scored for the likelihood of fraud during the call setup request phase. Fraud scoring estimates the probability of fraud for each call based on the learned behavior of an individual subscriber and the learned behavior of fraud perpetrators. If fraud is not suspected based on the fraud score, then normal call processing can resume without the need for authentication. If fraud is suspected based on the fraud score, then the system automatically invokes authentication. If authentication indicates suspicion of fraud, e.g., voice prints do not match, then the call may be either be blocked or referred for other appropriate prevention measures, e.g., intercepted by an operator. If fraud is not indicated by authentication, then normal call processing may resume. ",No

" &lt;heading lvl=  0  &gt;Abstract&lt;/heading&gt; An automated trading exchange having integrated quote risk monitoring and quote modification services.  An apparatus is implemented using at least one computer, having memory, and a processor.  The computer is configured to receive orders and quotes, wherein specified ones of the quotes are contained in a quote group, and have associated trading parameters such as a risk threshold.  Not all received quotes are required to have trading parameters as described herein.  Preferably, the quote group contains all the quotes, or a subset of quotes, belonging to an individual market-maker for a given class of options contracts, or possibly the quotes of two or more market-makers that have identified themselves as belonging to a group for the purposes of risk monitoring and quote modification.  The computer typically generates a trade by matching the received orders and quotes to previously received orders and quotes, and otherwise stores each of the received orders and quotes if a trade is not generated.  The computer then determines whether a quote within the quote group has been filled as a result of the generated trade, and if so, determines a risk level and an aggregate risk level associated with said trade.  The computer then compares the aggregate risk level with the market-maker's risk threshold, and if the threshold is exceeded, automatically modifies at least one of the remaining quotes in the quote group.  The computer may also automatically regenerate quotes that have been filled. ",No

" The present invention relates to a system and method for using an e-duction card as a payment instrument, whereby a purchase price of articles purchased on-line or off-line is deducted from an employee's paycheck. The e-duction card is similar to a credit card but is not bound by the same terms and conditions of a credit card. An employer authorizes the inventive system to accept payroll deduction as a payment option for the employer's employees. The employer and/or the system establish guidelines for utilizing the payroll deduction option during commerce and the system stores the guidelines and identifying information for the employer and corresponding employees in a database. Merchants also sign up with the inventive system and agree to accept the e-duction card is a payment instrument. Thereafter, when an employee selects articles from the merchant's web site or store, the employee may use the e-duction card to pay for the selected articles. A magnetic stripe on the e-duction card stores a employee's account information. When a consumer purchases a product and uses the e-duction card as a payment instrument, the account information on the e-duction magnetic stripe is transmitted to a network processor with- access to information stored on the database. The processor verifies the employee and merchant status, and the employee account information in order to approve or reject the transaction.

" The present invention provides a method for determining whether to execute an order (or list of orders) immediately, or delay execution in exchange for a possible price savings. The method's generality enables the investor to optimize order decisions given individual beliefs about expected security returns and variance, risk aversion, and portfolio investment goals. Starting from an expected utility framework, the method maximizes the expected gains associated with trading. The method encompasses the case in which the investor plans to trade the security within a specified trading window as well as the case in which trading occurs only at attractive prices. Additionally, under the assumption of constant absolute risk aversion, the method resembles a traditional mean-variance analysis commonly used in equity portfolio management. The method also generalizes to handle the case of multiple orders and enables an investor to consider an order strategy taking overall portfolio risk into account. The method also can be used in conjunction with dynamic cost control techniques.The method of the invention is the first such method to consider the maximization of gains in an order context as a function of both returns and the probability of the order being executed. This method is also unique in that it simultaneously accounts for the opportunity costs and the adverse selection costs of using discounted, uncertain orders such as equity limit orders, POSIT(R) trades, equity principal order trading, etc. ",No
" A network-based system and method for providing anonymous voice communications using the telephone network and data communications links under the direction of a Call Broker and associated network elements. A user (the call initiator) present in a text chat room session establishes a data connection to Call Broker and, after qualifying for access (e.g., using credit card information) and providing a callback number, receives voice session information and participant access codes for each desired participant in a voice call. The initiator causes session information and participant codes to be passed to one or more selected chat participants in the current text chat room. When a selected participant uses the received session information, and enters the received participant code and a callback number, the Call Broker in cooperation with a Network Adjunct Processor (NAP) completes voice links to the initiator and the selected participant(s). The need for each party to have a second subscriber line is advantageously avoided by having the Call Broker arrange to have one or more voice links completed through a VoIP link, and further reduces the need for second lines for participants by forwarding a Call Broker-placed call to a busy participant line to the participant's Internet Service Provider (ISP), which then sends a message to the participant announcing one or more options for receiving the incoming call, including receiving the incoming call through a VoIP link.

" The present invention provides a method and system for valuing patent assets based on statistical survival analysis. An estimated value probability distribution curve is calculated for an identified group of patent assets using statistical analysis of PTO maintenance fee records. Expected valuations for individual patent assets are calculated based on the value distribution curve and a comparative ranking or rating of individual patent assets relative to other patents in the group of identified patents. Patents having the highest percentile rankings would be correlated to the high end of the value distribution curve. Conversely, patents having the lowest percentile rankings would be correlated to the low end of the value distribution curve. Advantageously, such approach brings an added level of discipline to the overall valuation process in that the sum of individual patent valuations for a given patent population cannot exceed the total aggregate estimated value of all such patents. In this manner, fair and informative valuations can be provided based on the relative quality of the patent asset in question without need for comparative market data of other patents or patent portfolios, and without need for a demonstrated (or hypothetical) income streams for the patent in question. Estimated valuations are based simply on the allocation of a corresponding portion of the overall patent value   pie   as represented by each patents' relative ranking or position along a value distribution curve.
